## Project description:

A site which both allows you to plan your weekly meals and generates a shopping list based on the recipes you have selected.

### Problem domain:

People don't always know what ingredients are needed to create a meal they would like to make, and coming up with recipe ideas isn't always easy.

### User stories:

[x] As a user, I would like to log in to the site and set my food preferences/intolerances

[x] As a user, I would like to see recipes based on my preferences/intolerances

[x] As a user, I would like to add recipes I like to my weekly meal plan

[x] As a user, I would like to add all items from my recipes to my shopping list

[x] As a user, I would like to see all my items displayed in my shopping list

[x] As a user, I would like to check off the list the items I already have or whilst I am purchasing them
